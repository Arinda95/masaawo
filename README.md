The safe taxi initiative
Keeping your public tranportation safe
--------------------------------------

This is a project mean't to crowdsource information about taxis, private hires, uber and transport motorcycles
aka bodaboda that have allegedly been inlvolved in ciminal activity. License plate numbers are used as unique
identifiers of reported vehicles and phone numbers are used as identifiers of those reporting the vehicles.

The properly compiled database of vehicles will be readily available to users via api, site and hopefully through
the mobile application and USSD which is popular in uganda.


Problems & Innovations
----------------------
The biggest problem of this project is troll or malicious submission of vehicle numberplates. The numberplates cannot
be individually investigated due to the lack of skilled staff to carry out the investigation, lack of an open vehicle
regsitrations architecture at the URA and alleged connections between vehicular criminal elements and the uganda police
patnered with rapant corruption. As such this project will completely depend of technology.

Another issue is with the repercussions through unpredictable now that may result from the public having information
about alleged criminal vehicles. For that see legal below.

Innovations to combat the first problem of malicious submissions or trolls

-Phsychological honesty test at numberplate submission and at the false report removal, ofcourse this would have to be
 patnered up with language support to capacitate this multilingual country. This is banking on the predictablility of
 human phsychology. Dubbed the honesty engine. Additional security comes from having a phonenumber which costs money to register and activate so incase blocked for trolling it's a significant deterent. Deverification could also patner with
 KCCA, UTODA or any other.
