        <p>Masaawo is a tool created by an individual to help prevent criminal attacks
            through the public tranportation system by providing user submitted information to help users identify and
            avoid criminal transport vehicles.
             After a recent rise in vehicular robberies, many of which
             affected people close to me i sought to use my skills to
              mobilize the public to keep our tranportation system safe
              and to provide tools for members of the general public to
               safeguard themselves.
